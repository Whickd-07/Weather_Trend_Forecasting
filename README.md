# Weather Trend Forecasting - Basic Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing weather trends using fundamental exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and simple forecasting models. The dataset used is `GlobalWeatherRepository.csv`, containing information on temperature, humidity, and other weather-related attributes. The goal is to clean the data, perform initial analysis, and build a basic predictive model.

## Objectives
- Conduct **basic EDA** to understand weather trends.
- Handle missing values and perform data cleaning.
- Implement a simple **forecasting model** for temperature prediction.
- Visualize key weather patterns using plots and graphs.
- Store results and visualizations in a structured report.

## Dataset
- **Source**: GlobalWeatherRepository.csv
- **Features**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, location, timestamp.
- **Target Variable**: Temperature (Celsius).

## Data Processing
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove or impute missing values.
   - Convert timestamp columns to datetime format.
   - Standardize column names for consistency.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract relevant date-time features (e.g., day, month, year).
   - Handle categorical variables where necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Summary Statistics**: Mean, median, min, max values.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Line plots for temperature trends.
  - Histograms to analyze data distributions.
  - Box plots to identify outliers.

## Forecasting Model
- **Linear Regression Model**
  - Trained on selected features to predict temperature.
  - Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Results and Insights
- Identified general weather trends based on past data.
- Built a basic temperature forecasting model with reasonable accuracy.
- Visualized temperature variations and seasonal patterns.

## Deliverables
- **GitHub Repository** with dataset, code, and analysis.
- **EDA Report (Markdown/PDF)** summarizing key insights.
- **Graphs and charts** for better data interpretation.
